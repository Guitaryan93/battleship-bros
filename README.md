# battleship-bros
This is a Battleship style game written in Python 3.
This is the REPOSITORY where Battleships will be collaborated on!

We will write Battleships using Python 3, some bitchin' ASCII graphics, maybe some military sounding MIDI music and a shit ton of time...

Add to this file anything that is relevant to the game but not part of the code. e.g. links to resources, images, ideas, sketching code, ramblings, etc...
